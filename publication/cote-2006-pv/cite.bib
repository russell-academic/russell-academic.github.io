 abstract = {We study the implementation of quantum random walks (QRWs) in a realistic system, an optical lattice of ultracold Rydberg atoms. The power-law nature of the dipolar interaction between Rydberg atoms influences the behaviour of QRWs. We discuss the QRW with a short-range nearest-neighbour interaction for two types of power-law interactions, the dipole--dipole and the van der Waals interaction. A specific scheme to implement a QRW using Rydberg atoms in different sites of an optical lattice is described, in which the sites are prepared using a blockade mechanism to ensure a single Rydberg atom per site.},
